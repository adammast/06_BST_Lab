==============

Implement a binary search tree in C++

Requirements
------------

1. All methods except the destructor and `size()` should be O(h), where h is the height of the tree
2. `size()` should be O(n)

Reading
=======
"Open Data Structures," Chapter 6, the entire chapter. http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_Binary_Trees.html

Questions
=========

#### 1. Which of the above requirements work, and which do not? For each requirement, write a brief response.

1. Works, all methods are O(h) time except size and destructor.
2. Works, size is O(n) because it has to count each element.

#### 2. Do exercises 6.7 and 6.9 on http://opendatastructures.org/ods-cpp/6_3_Discussion_Exercises.html. Keep in mind: You do NOT need to write real working code, you may write pseudo-code. In fact, that is preferred.

#### 3. What is one question that confused you about this exercise, or one piece of advice you would share with students next semester?

		My advice, make sure to give yourselves plenty of time to work on this one since it takes quite a while.
